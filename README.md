## Desktop Organizer with AI
This is a script that uses machine learning to automatically organize your desktop. It classifies your files based on their contents and moves them into subdirectories for each label. This project uses tkinter for the user interface, nltk and sklearn for the machine learning part, and python-magic to determine file types.

Features

* Load a pre-trained model.
* Select from multiple trained models.
* Backup and restore your desktop.
